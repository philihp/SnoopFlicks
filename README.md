# Project 1 - SnoopFlicks

SnoopFlicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 25 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters. Poster images load asynchronously.
- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.
- [x] User sees an error message when there is a network error.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- [x] Add a tab bar for **Now Playing** and **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Implement segmented control to switch between list view and grid view.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a search bar.
- [ ] All images fade in.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low-res image first, switch to high-res when complete.
- [ ] Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Tapping on a movie poster image shows the movie poster as full screen and zoomable.
- [ ] User can tap on a button to play the movie trailer.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Tab bar is black, like the rest of the elements. Background when Table View isn't there is also black, which shines through the nav and tab bar because they're translucent... this was ugly when it was white.
- [ ] Was unable to get Refresh Control to work on Poster view. I think it's something wrong with how the page is structured half-programmatically
